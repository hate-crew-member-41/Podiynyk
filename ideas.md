# Views

## Students

The tile and the page of a student are themed according to their theme instead of the user's one.
The theme's values could be displayed.


# Features

## Subjects

It is possible to add multiple subjects at once.

## Schedule

It is possible to add the time schedule.


# User

## Local copy

There is a local copy of the user's data. This saves a ton of reads.

## Sync on demand

The user is only updated in cloud when the change is visible to others,
or when the user does it explicitly. It is unnecessary to update the cloud every time the user marks
an event as done.This makes the whole project twice as cheap to maintain.

## Account management

It is possible to manage the account even without the group specified.
That is, merge the group identification process with Home,
show the group id form instead of the sections until the group id is given.
